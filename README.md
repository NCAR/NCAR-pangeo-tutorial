## Setup

This tutorial covers the installation and setup of a Python environment on:

- Cheyenne
- Casper
- CGD's Hobart
- Personal laptop/desktop with a UNIX-variant Operating System

**NOTE:** For windows users, setup scripts provided in this repository don't work on Windows machines for the time being. You may want to follow the instructions available [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html).

### Step 1: Clone NCAR Python Tutorial Repository

Run the following commmand to clone this repo to your system(e.g. cheyenne, casper, your laptop, etc...):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ncar-python-tutorial.git
```

### Step 2: Install miniconda and create environments

- Change directory to the cloned repository

  ```bash
  cd ncar-python-tutorial
  ```

- Run the [`configure`](./setup/configure) script:

  ```bash
  ./setup/configure
  ```

  This script will install `conda` package manager if it is unable to find an existing installation. Otherwise, it will update the `base` environment, create an `analysis` environment (if a conda environment called `analysis` exists, it will update packages in it).  
  
**NOTE**: Be prepared for the script to take up to 15 minutes to complete.  

### Step 3: Close and re-open your current shell

For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell.

### Step 4: Run the setup verification script

- Check that *conda info* runs successfully:

  ```bash
  conda info
  ```

- From the `ncar-python-tutorial` directory, activate the newly created analysis enviroment:
  
  ```bash
  conda activate analysis
  ```

- Run the setup verification script to confirm that everything is working as expected:
  
  ```bash
  cd ncar-python-tutorial
  ./setup/check_setup
  ```
  This step should print **"Everything looks good!"**.

## Launch Jupyter Lab

### 1. Cheyenne or DAV via JupyterHub: https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/

(Recommended)

To use the Cheyenne or DAV compute nodes, we recommend using JupyterLab via NCAR's JupyterHub deployment.

Open your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc...) on your ``local machine``, and head over to https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/.

**You will need to authenticate with either your _yubikey_ or your _DUO_ mobile app**

### 2. Cheyenne or DAV via SSH Tunneling

In case you are having issues with jupyterhub.ucar.edu, we've provided utility scripts for launching JupyterLab on both Cheyenne and Casper via SSH Tunneling:

```bash
conda activate base
./setup/jlab/jlab-ch # on Cheyenne
./setup/jlab/jlab-dav # on Casper
```

### 3. Hobart via SSH Tunneling

For those interested in running JupyterLab on CGD's Hobart, you will need to use SSH tunneling script provided in [``setup/jlab/jlab-hobart``](./setup/jlab/jlab-hobart)

```bash
conda activate base
./setup/jlab/jlab-hobart
```

```bash
$ ./setup/jlab/jlab-hobart --help
Usage: launch dask
Possible options are:
 -w,--walltime: walltime [default: 08:00:00]
 -q,--queue: queue [default: medium]
 -d,--directory: notebook directory
 -p,--port: [default: 8888]
```

### 4. Personal Laptop

For those interested in running JupyterLab on their local machine, you can simply run the following command, and follow the printed instructions on the console:

```bash
conda activate base
jupyter lab
```
